- Recommended prerequisite: CS230 System Programming, proficiency in C/C++ programming and Linux utilities
  - Due to the high load of TA, TA will not provide help for basic C/C++/Linux questions.
  - This class can be difficult to follow for exchange students.
  <!-- hly recommend to take CS458 after taking CS230 System Programming first -->
  
- Grading: attendance/class participation/quiz: 20%, HW: 50%, mid/final exams:30%
  - You should turn on your web cam when you participate an online class; class attendance will not be counted otherwise.
  - More than 7 absences of the class will get F grade
  - Late attendance shall be counted as 1/3 absence. If a student is not able to attend a class due to an important event (e.g., attending conf., etc.), he/she should submit 1 week prior notice to the professor.
  - The official language in the class is English. All students should submit all written documents such as homework, project reports, exam, etc. in English; 20% penalty of the max score otherwise.  

- Homework:
  - Homework should be submitted through KLMS https://klms.kaist.ac.kr/course/view.php?id=156169
    - Hint: many questions of exams are from the homeworks.
  - Late HW will be accepted with 10% penalty of the max score in 1 day, 30% penalty of the max score in 3 days. HW will not be accepted after then.
  - All programming HWs you submit must be able to be replayed by executing a single script file on a TA's server account (i.e., submitted HW should not have a dependency on your home directory, environment, etc.).  Also, the replayed execution must demonstrate the same output to the submitted hw. You will get 10% penalty of the max score otherwise.
  - For your programming HWs, you should not use external libraries which are not available on the server machines.  If you really need an external library, you have to ask TAs to install it on the server machines.
  - Please, include your student ID in the name of your submiited file(s), so that TAs can easily identify which files are yours.
  
- Questions on the course materials and homeworks should be posted as github issues

- Excerpts from 강의평가 (4.93 out of 5 in Spring 23)
    
    - "이번 학기에 졸업하는데, 지금까지 들은 과목 중 가장 재미있고 실용적이었던 것 같아요! 과제도 이전 평에 비해 너무 어렵지 않고 딱 적당했던 것 같습니다."  
    - "테스팅에 대해 많이 배워갈 수 있었습니다. 과제가 많긴 하지만 다 도움이 되는 것 같습니다. 감사합니다."
    - "먼저, 좋은 강의 해주셔서 진심으로 감사합니다. 본 강의를 통해 전반적인 테스팅 기법들에 대해 알 수 있었던 것 같습니다. 특히, fuzzing, concolic testing, SMT solver 등 실질적으로 써먹을 수 있는 기법들을 실습과 병행해서 잘 배울 수 있었던 것 같습니다... 이번 학기 가장 많은 것을 얻은 과목이라고 자부합니다. 교수님께서 학생들에게 진심을 다해 강의해주시는 모습을 보며 큰 동기부여가 되었고, 많은 지식을 습득할 수 있었던 것 같습니다. 항상 감사합니다."

## Syllabus
This class covers automated SW testing/verification techniques to detect SW bugs by analyzing **SW source code** and its **diverse runtime behaviors**. In particular, this class focuses to teach techniques that automatically generate test cases to achieve high code coverage and, thus, to detect many bugs. 

The class teaches **practical applications** of testing/verification techniques by applying open-source testing/verification tools to complete homework tasks. Also, it guides students to learn the underlying fundamental algorithms of such techniques/tools to improve the performance of automated testing/verification.
